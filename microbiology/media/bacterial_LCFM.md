## üß™ Abstract
A simple protocol for the creation of a basic carbon free minimal media for bacterial growth. This is not an optimised protocol for growth, it is the base media to which different carbon sources can be added to detect bacterial growth and therefore metabolism of added carbon sources. The media can be used for liquid cultures, or combined with agar for solid media.

## üì£ Disclaimer

This is not an optimised media for growth. Just a carbon-free base.

---

## üß≠ Guidelines

Can adapt any of the volumes for your requirements. Also you can use whatever other glass vessels for mixing or autoclaving that you prefer or are available.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

> Always remember when autoclaving to use a larger glass vessel than the volume you want to autoclave to avoid it boiling over.
> Always remember to leave the bottle caps loose on duran bottles when autoclaving!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Method

### 10X M9 Salts
1. Add the following salts to a 2000 mL duran bottle:
  - 55 g Na2HPO4‚Ä¢5H2O
  - 15 g KH2PO4
  - 2.5 g NaCl
  - 5 g NH4Cl

2. Add 800 mL dH2O and stir with a magnetic stirrer until dissolved

3. Once fully dissolved, make up to 1000 mL with dH2O and autoclave

### 1000X Trace metals

1. Add the following to a 250 mL beaker:
  - 0.28 g FeSO4‚Ä¢7H2O
  - 0.24 g MnSO4‚Ä¢5H2O
  - 0.24 g CuSO4‚Ä¢5H2O
  - 0.28 g ZnSO4‚Ä¢7H2O

2. Add 80 mL dH2O and stir with a magnetic stirrer until dissolved

3. Once fully dissolved, make up to 100 mL with dH2O

4. Move into a sterilised laminar flow hood and filter sterilise through 0.22 Œºm pore using a syringe into an empty autoclaved 100 mL duran bottle

### 1 M MgSO4

1. Add the following to a 250 mL beaker:
  - 24.65 g MgSO4‚Ä¢7H2O

2. Add 80 mL dH2O and stir with a magnetic stirrer until dissolved

3. Once fully dissolved, make up to 100 mL with dH2O

4. Move into a sterilised laminar flow hood and filter sterilise through 0.22 Œºm pore using a syringe into an empty autoclaved 100 mL duran bottle

### 1 M CaCl2

1. Add the following to a 250 mL beaker:
  - 14.7 g CaCl2

2. Add 80 mL dH2O and stir with a magnetic stirrer until dissolved

3. Once fully dissolved, make up to 100 mL with dH2O

4. Move into a sterilised laminar flow hood and filter sterilise through 0.22 Œºm pore using a syringe into an empty autoclaved 100 mL duran bottle

### Preparing Liquid Carbon Free Media (LCFM)

1. Combine the following in a 1000 mL duran bottle:
  - 100 mL 10X M9 Salts
  - 2 mL 1 M MgSO4
  - 0.1 mL 1 M CaCl2
  - 1 mL 1000X Trace Metals

2. Make up to 1000 mL with dH2O

3. The media is now ready for liquid cultures or LCFM agar plates
