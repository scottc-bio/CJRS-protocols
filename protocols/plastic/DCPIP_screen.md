## Method

*Work in a sterile laminar flow hood*

**Pre-cultures of isolates**

1. Using a sterile P100 pipette tip, touch the tip against the contents of the isolate glycerol stock and streak onto an LB-agar plate

2. Incubate the plate upside down in a 37 °C incubator overnight

3. The following day, add 5 mL sterile LB to a sterile 15 mL falcon tube

4. Using a sterile P100 pipette tip, pick a single colony from the LB-plate and eject the tip into the LB-containing tube

5. Secure the lid of the tube but leave slightly loose and place in a shaking incubator at 37 °C and 180 rpm overnight

**Preparing experimental cultures**

1. Add the following to 4 x sterile 50 mL falcon tubes
 a. Nothing
 b. 100 mg washed PE
 c. 100 mg washed PP
 d. 100 mg washed PS

2. Add 10 mL bacterial LCFM to each tube

3. Prepare these tubes in duplicate for an uninoculated control

**Inoculation of DCPIP screening cultures**

1. Transfer 100 μL of the pre-culture to a cuvette and dilute 1/10 by adding 900 μL of sterile PBS, also prepare a reference cuvette of sterile LB diluted in the same way

2. Measure the OD at 600 nm and make note

3. Centrifuge the remaining pre-culture at 1000 xg for 5 minutes

4. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet by pipetting in 1 mL sterile PBS

5. Repeat the centrifugation and resuspension twice more, but use 1 mL sterile bacterial LCFM for the final resuspension

6. Measure the OD at 600 nm using a 1/10 dilution as before but this time with a reference of bacterial LCFM

7. Calculate the inoculation volume to give an OD of 0.01 in the 10 mL cultures using the followin equation:

Inoculation volume = (Target OD / Measured OD) x Final volume

e.g. (0.01 / 0.5) x 10 mL = 0.2 mL

8. Add this volume to each of the four 50 mL falcon tubes prepared

9. Finally, add 3 μL 1 mM DCPIP (final concentration 30 μM) to all tubes, including non-inoculated controls

10. Incubate all tubes with lids slightly loose at a 45° angle at 37 °C with shaking at 180 rpm for 7-10 days

**Tracking redox activity**

1. Every day, transfer 150 μL of cultures into eppendorf tubes

2. Centrifuge at 10,000 xg for 5 minutes to pellet plastic particles and bacterial cells

3. Take 100 mL supernatant and transfer to a cuvette, dilute 1/10 with 900 μL bacterial LCFM

4. Measure OD at 600 nm using bacterial LCFM as the reference

5. To detect redox activity compare the OD in the presence of plastic to the OD in the presence of DCPIP only and the uninoculated DCPIP only control

## Additional notes
If screening multiple isolates, then only one set of uninoculated controls are necessary.
