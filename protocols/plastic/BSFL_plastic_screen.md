## 🧪 Abstract
A protocol for the initial screening of plastic-degrading fungal or bacterial taxa from the gut microbiota of *H. illuciens* reared on a standard diet or diets containing polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), or polypropylene (PP). Screening is based on bacterial or fungal growth in liquid cultures or solid media containing plastic particles of PE, PS, or PP.

## 📣 Disclaimer

This experimental setup is a preliminary screen for potential plastic-degrading taxa. Plastic particles were not selected for optimal growth but chosen based on availability.

---

## 🧭 Guidelines

Plastic particle characteristics as follows:
**Need to insert characteristics when we know**

This protocol attempts to avoid any harsh treatment of the plastic which may alter its structure or introduce toxic chemicals that may inhibit the growth of microorganisms.

## ⚠️ Warning

Always remember when autoclaving to use a larger glass vessel than the volume you want to autoclave to avoid it boiling over. 
Always remember to leave the bottle caps loose on duran bottles when autoclaving!
Wear goggles and a mask when handling plastic particles.

## ⚙️ Method

### Harvesting gut microbiota
1. Place the sterile 100 mL PBS on ice

2. Wipe a plastic pestle with 70 % (v/v) ethanol

3. Prepare 6 sterile eppendorfs for each of the conditions
  - Label each with: “STD:PE”, “STD:PS”, “STD:PP”, “PE”, “PS”, “PP”

4. Starting with the STD reared larvae, select 3 larvae, rinse with tap water to remove diet, then clean with 70 % (v/v) ethanol

5. Dissect each larvae to extract the midgut and place all 3 midguts in the same tube labelled “STD:PE”

6. Add 500 μL sterile ice-cold PBS to the tube

7. Homogenise the midgut solution by smashing with plastic pestles

8. Store midgut suspension on ice

9. Repeat twice more for the STD reared larvae to prepare “STD:PS” and “STD:PP” tubes

10. Repeat with sets of 3 larvae from PE, PS, and PP reared conditions to prepare tubes for each condition

11. Store midgut suspensions at 4 °C

### Preparing liquid cultures

1. Add 50 mL Fungal LCFM to 6 x 100 mL conical flasks
  - Label each with: “STD:PE”, “STD:PS”, “STD:PP”, “PE”, “PS”, “PP”

2. Add 50 mL Bacterial LCFM to 12 x 100 mL conical flasks
  - Label 6 flasks with: “STD:PE”, “STD:PS”, “STD:PP”, “PE”, “PS”, “PP” + “Aerobic”
  - Label 6 flasks with: “STD:PE”, “STD:PS”, “STD:PP”, “PE”, “PS”, “PP” + “Anaerobic”

3. Seal flasks and autoclave

4. In a sterile laminar flow hood, add 0.5 g of each powdered plastics (10 g/L) to the corresponding flasks

5. Starting with the 3 “STD:PE” labelled flasks, inoculate each 50 μL of midgut suspension labelled correspondingly

6. Repeat inoculation for the remaining conditions

7. Incubate all flasks at 45 °C with shaking at 180 rpm

### Preparing solid media

1. Add 800 mL Fungal LCFM to a 1 L duran bottle, add 1.2 g agar, autoclave

2. Add 800 mL Bacterial LCFM to 2 x 1 L duran bottles, add 1.2 g agar to each, autoclave

3. Prepare 72 sterile petri dishes in a laminar flow hood and label 18 each with: “10 g/L”, “20 g/L”, “10 g/L Tween 5 %” and “20 g/L Tween 5 %”
  - Take 3 of each condition (12 in total) and label all 3 with: “STD:PE”, “STD:PS”, “STD:PP”, “PE”, “PS”, or “PP”
  - Label 1 of each of these (4 in total) with “Fungal”
  - Label 2 of each of these (8 in total) with “Bacterial”
  - Take 1 of each condition labelled “Bacterial” (4 in total) and label with “Aerobic”
  - Take 1 of each condition labelled “Bacterial” (the remaining 4) and label with “Anaerobic”

4. Prepare 72 sterile falcon tubes labelled in the same way

5. In a sterile laminar flow hood, add 0.3 g of each plastic powder to each of the tubes labelled with “10 g/L” and 0.6 g to tubes labelled “20 g/L”

6. Add 1.5 mL Tween20 to all tubes labelled with “Tween 5 %” using a sterile 1.5 mL syringe

7. When agar is still molten add 30 mL to a single falcon tube, and vortex to distribute the plastic particles

8. Pour plastic containing agar into the corresponding petri dish

9. Allow all plates to cool until set

10. Once set, start with the “STD:PE” and using a sterile inoculation loop streak a loop of “STD:PE” midgut suspension onto the plates

11. Repeat for all other conditions

12. Incubate plates upside down at 45 °C
