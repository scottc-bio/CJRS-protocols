## Abstract
A protocol for the initial screening of plastic-degrading fungal or bacterial taxa from the gut microbiota of *Hermetia illuciens* (BSFL) reared on diets containing polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), or polypropylene (PP). Screening is based on bacterial or fungal growth in liquid cultures or solid media containing plastic particles of PE, PS, or PP.

## Method

### Preparing liquid cultures

1. Add 50 mL Fungal LCFM to 3 x 250 mL conical flasks
  - Label each with: ‚ÄúPE Fungal‚Äù, ‚ÄúPS Fungal‚Äù, ‚ÄúPP Fungal‚Äù


2. Add 50 mL Bacterial LCFM to 6 x 250 mL conical flasks
  - Label 3 flasks with: ‚ÄúPE Bacterial Aerobic‚Äù, ‚ÄúPS Bacterial Aerobic‚Äù, ‚ÄúPP Bacterial Aerobic‚Äù
  - Label 3 flasks with: ‚ÄúPE Bacterial Anaerobic‚Äù, ‚ÄúPS Bacterial Anaerobic‚Äù, ‚ÄúPP Bacterial Anaerobic‚Äù


3. Seal flasks with the sponge/paper bungs, cover with tin foil and autoclave

4. In a sterile laminar flow hood, add 0.5 g of each powdered plastics (10 g/L) to the corresponding flasks

### Preparing solid media

1. Add 800 mL Fungal LCFM to a 1 L duran bottle, add 1.2 g agar, autoclave

2. Add 800 mL Bacterial LCFM to 2 x 1 L duran bottles, add 1.2 g agar to each, autoclave

3. Prepare 36 sterile petri dishes in a laminar flow hood and label 9 each with: ‚Äú10 g/L‚Äù, ‚Äú20 g/L‚Äù, ‚Äú10 g/L Tween 2.5 %‚Äù and ‚Äú20 g/L Tween 2.5 %‚Äù
  - Take 3 of each condition (12 in total) and label all 3 with: ‚ÄúPE‚Äù, ‚ÄúPS‚Äù, or ‚ÄúPP‚Äù
  - Label 1 of each of these (4 in total) with ‚ÄúFungal‚Äù
  - Label 2 of each of these (8 in total) with ‚ÄúBacterial‚Äù
  - Take 1 of each condition labelled ‚ÄúBacterial‚Äù (4 in total) and label with ‚ÄúAerobic‚Äù
  - Take 1 of each condition labelled ‚ÄúBacterial‚Äù (the remaining 4) and label with ‚ÄúAnaerobic‚Äù

4. Prepare 6 additional petri dishes:
   - Label 3 with: "Agar control"
   - Label the other 3 with: "Agar + Tween control"
   - Label 1 of each of these sets of 3 with either: "Fungal", "Bacterial Aerobic", or "Bacterial Anaerobic"
   - Divide each plate roughly equally into thirds by drawing on the base and label each section with: "PE", "PS", "PP"


5. Prepare 42 sterile falcon tubes labelled in the exact same way as the tubes i.e. a single falcon tube for each petri dish

6. In a sterile laminar flow hood, add 0.3 g of each plastic powder to each of the tubes labelled with ‚Äú10 g/L‚Äù and 0.6 g to tubes labelled ‚Äú20 g/L‚Äù. Add nothing to the control tubes

7. Dilute 25 mL Tween20 with 25 mL dH2O, and then in the flow-hood filter sterilise through a 0.22 Œºm filter into a sterile falcon tube.

8. Add 1.5 mL of the diluted and filter-sterilised Tween20 to all tubes labelled with ‚ÄúTween 2.5 %‚Äù using a sterile 1.5 mL syringe, including the 3 controls labelled with "Tween"

9. When Fungal LCFM agar is still molten add 30 mL to a single falcon tube labelled with "Fungal", and vortex to distribute the plastic particles as best as possible

10. Pour plastic containing agar into the corresponding petri dish and pour the non-plastic containing controls also

11. Repeat for the Bacterial LCFM agar

12. Allow all plates to cool until set

### Harvesting gut microbiota

1. Wipe a plastic pestle with 70 % (v/v) ethanol

2. Prepare 9 sterile eppendorfs for each each of the three plastics and for the three growth conditions
  - Label with: "PE Fungal", "PE Bacterial Aerobic", "PE Bacterial Anaerobic", "PS Fungal", "PS Bacterial Aerobic", "PS Bacterial Anaerobic", "PP Fungal", "PP Bacterial Aerobic", "PP Bacterial Anaerobic"

3. Starting with the PE reared larvae, select 3 larvae of roughly the same size, rinse with tap water to remove diet, then clean with 70 % (v/v) ethanol

4. Dissect each larvae to extract the midgut and place all 3 midguts in the same tube labelled ‚ÄúPE Fungal‚Äù

6. Now working in a sterile laminar flow-hood, add 500 ŒºL sterile Fungal LCFM

7. Homogenise the midgut solution by smashing with plastic pestles and with occasional vortexing

8. Using a sterile inoculation loop streak a loop of ‚ÄúPE Fungal‚Äù midgut suspension onto the "PE Fungal" plates, taking a new loop each time from the midgut suspension with a new inoculation loop. Also streak a loop onto the "PE" section of the "Fungal" control plates

9. Repeat for all other conditions

10. Incubate plates upside down at 30 ¬∞C

11.  With the remaining "PE Fungal" midgut suspension, take 150 ŒºL using sterile pipette tips and inoculate into the "PE Fungal" liquid culture

12. Repeat liquid culture inoculation for the remaining conditions

7. Incubate all flasks at 30 ¬∞C with shaking at 120 rpm

## Additional notes
Dissection of larvae was not covered here but is covered comprehensively in the [BugBook](https://doi.org/10.1163/23524588-20250002)
For the agar, it is essentially an additional carbon source that might encourage bacterial or fungal growth. This is why control plates are used, but using a higher purity agar reduces the likelihood of something growing on the plates despite not having any plasticolytic activity.

## Disclaimer

This experimental setup is a preliminary screen for potential plastic-degrading taxa. Plastic particles were not selected for optimal growth but chosen based on availability.

---

## Guidelines

Plastic particle characteristics as follows:
**Need to insert characteristics when we know**

This protocol attempts to avoid any harsh treatment of the plastic which may alter its structure or introduce toxic chemicals that may inhibit the growth of microorganisms.

---

## Warning

Always remember when autoclaving to use a larger glass vessel than the volume you want to autoclave to avoid it boiling over. 
Always remember to leave the bottle caps loose on duran bottles when autoclaving!
Wear goggles and a mask when handling plastic particles.
