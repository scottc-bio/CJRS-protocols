## üß™ Abstract
A simple protocol for the creation of a basic carbon free minimal media for fungal growth. This is not an optimised protocol for growth, it is the base media to which different carbon sources can be added to detect fungal growth and therefore metabolism of added carbon sources. The media can be used for liquid cultures, or combined with agar for solid media.

## üóùÔ∏è Keywords

Microbiology, Minimal, Media, Fungal, Carbon-Free

---

## üì£ Disclaimer

This is not an optimised media for growth. Just a carbon-free base.

---

## üß≠ Guidelines

Can adapt any of the volumes for your requirements. Also you can use whatever other glass vessels for mixing or autoclaving that you prefer or are available.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

> Always remember when autoclaving to use a larger glass vessel than the volume you want to autoclave to avoid it boiling over.
> Always remember to leave the bottle caps loose on duran bottles when autoclaving!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Method

### 1000X Hutner's Trace Elements

**Solution 1**

1. Combine the following in a 100 mL glass duran/beaker:
  - 1 g FeSO4‚Ä¢H2O
  - 10 g EDTA

2. Add 80 mL dH2O and stir with a magnetic stirrer until fully dissolved

**Solution 2**

3. Combine the following in a 100 mL glass duran/beaker:
  - 4.4 g ZnSO4‚Ä¢7H2O
  - 2.2 g H3BO3
  - 1 g MnCl2‚Ä¢4H2O
  - 0.32 g CoCl2‚Ä¢6H2O
  - 0.32 g CuSO4‚Ä¢5H2O
  - 0.22 g (NH4)6Mo7O24‚Ä¢4H2O (Ammonium molybdate)

4. Add 80 mL dH2O and stir with a magnetic stirrer until fully dissolved

5. Combine solutions 1 and 2 in a 250 mL duran bottle

6. Adjust the pH with KOH to pH 6.5

7. Bring the final volume up to 200 mL with dH2O

8. Cover the bottle with foil and store at 4 ¬∞C, during storage the solution will turn from bright green to purple which is normal

### 20X Fungal Minimal Salts

1. Combine the following in a 2000 mL duran bottle:
  - 120 g NaNO3
  - 10.4 g KCl
  - 16.3 g KH2PO4
  - 20.9 g K2HPO4

2. Add 800 mL dH2O and stir with a magnetic stirrer until fully dissolved

3. Once dissolved, make up to 1000 mL and autoclave

4. Store at 4 ¬∞C

### 1 M MgSO4

1. Add the following to a 250 mL beaker:
  - 24.65 g MgSO4‚Ä¢7H2O

2. Add 80 mL dH2O and stir with a magnetic stirrer until dissolved

3. Once fully dissolved, make up to 100 mL with dH2O

4. Move into a sterilised laminar flow hood and filter sterilise through 0.22 Œºm pore using a syringe into an empty autoclaved 100 mL duran bottle

### Preparing Liquid Carbon Free Media (LCFM)

1. Combine the following in a 2000 mL duran bottle:
  - 50 mL 20X fungal minimal salts
  - 2 mL 1M MgSO4
  - 1 mL Hutner's trace elements

2. Make up to 1000 mL with dH2O

3. The media is now ready for liquid cultures or LCFM agar plates

## üßæ Additional notes ##

Take the ph adjustment of the Hutner's elements step slowly, don't add too much high concentration KOH straight away. You want to avoid causing precipitation of the salts.
