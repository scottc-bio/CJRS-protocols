## Abstract
A simple protocol for the creation of a basic carbon free minimal media for bacterial growth. This is not an optimised protocol for growth, it is the base media to which different carbon sources can be added to detect bacterial growth and therefore metabolism of added carbon sources. The media can be used for liquid cultures, or combined with agar for solid media.

## Materials & Equipment
**Chemicals**
- Na2HPO4•5H2O
- KH2PO4
- NaCl
- NH4Cl
- FeSO4•7H2O
- MnSO4•5H2O
- CuSO4•5H2O
- ZnSO4•7H2O
- MgSO4•7H2O
- CaCl2
- dH2O

**Glassware**
- 2000 mL durans
- 1000 mL durans
- 250 mL durans
- 100 mL durans
- 100 mL durans (autoclaved)
- 250 mL beaker

**Equipment**
- Magnetic stirring equipment (not completely necessary, can stir/shake manually)
- Laminar flow hood (if unavailable, then can use a bunsen burner and good sterile technique around the sphere of influence)
- Sterile syringes
- 0.22 μm pores for filter sterilisation

## Method

### 10X M9 Salts
1. Add the following salts to a 2000 mL duran bottle:
  - 55 g Na2HPO4•5H2O
  - 15 g KH2PO4
  - 2.5 g NaCl
  - 5 g NH4Cl

2. Add 800 mL dH2O and stir with a magnetic stirrer until dissolved

3. Once fully dissolved, make up to 1000 mL with dH2O and autoclave

**Note:** Any impurities in water/glassware can lead to the formation of white crystals that form during autoclaving. These will dissolve when diluted to 1x when preparing LCFM, so not a huge issue. But remember to swirl the bottle of 10x salts to homogenise the solution before pouring to make LCFM. If you are intent on a no precipitant solution, then filter-sterilisation may be used as an alternative to autoclaving.

### 1000X Trace metals

1. Add the following to a 250 mL beaker:
  - 0.28 g FeSO4•7H2O
  - 0.24 g MnSO4•5H2O
  - 0.24 g CuSO4•5H2O
  - 0.28 g ZnSO4•7H2O

2. Add 80 mL dH2O and stir with a magnetic stirrer until dissolved

3. Once fully dissolved, make up to 100 mL with dH2O

4. Move into a sterilised laminar flow hood and filter sterilise through 0.22 μm pore using a syringe into an empty autoclaved 100 mL duran bottle

### 1 M MgSO4

1. Add the following to a 250 mL beaker:
  - 24.65 g MgSO4•7H2O

2. Add 80 mL dH2O and stir with a magnetic stirrer until dissolved

3. Once fully dissolved, make up to 100 mL with dH2O

4. Move into a sterilised laminar flow hood and filter sterilise through 0.22 μm pore using a syringe into an empty autoclaved 100 mL duran bottle

### 1 M CaCl2

1. Add the following to a 250 mL beaker:
  - 14.7 g CaCl2

2. Add 80 mL dH2O and stir with a magnetic stirrer until dissolved

3. Once fully dissolved, make up to 100 mL with dH2O

4. Move into a sterilised laminar flow hood and filter sterilise through 0.22 μm pore using a syringe into an empty autoclaved 100 mL duran bottle

### Preparing Liquid Carbon Free Media (LCFM)

1. Combine the following in a 1000 mL duran bottle:
  - 100 mL 10X M9 Salts
  - 2 mL 1 M MgSO4
  - 0.1 mL 1 M CaCl2
  - 1 mL 1000X Trace Metals

2. Make up to 1000 mL with dH2O

3. The media is now ready for liquid cultures or LCFM agar plates

## Additional notes
- Trace metals are an optional addition. Some papers add many different trace elements. I add the common metal cofactors which may be important for enzyme activities.
- I often found that when combining the components for the bacterial LCFM a white precipitant may form that persists after autoclaving, this may pose an issue for

## Disclaimer

This is not an optimised media for growth. Just a carbon-free base.

---

## Guidelines

Can adapt any of the volumes for your requirements. Also you can use whatever other glass vessels for mixing or autoclaving that you prefer or are available.

---

## Warning

> Always remember when autoclaving to use a larger glass vessel than the volume you want to autoclave to avoid it boiling over.
> Always remember to leave the bottle caps loose on duran bottles when autoclaving!
