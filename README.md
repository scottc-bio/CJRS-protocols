# 🧬 Lab Protocols Repository

Welcome to my personal collection of in-development protocols for wetlab work.
This repository will serve as a record of my laboratory methods and approaches, with a major focus on microbiology and molecular biology, from the basics of media to experimental protocols specific to my research.

My protocols will be publicly available here prior to publishing at [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/cjr_protocols)

This repository will focus mainly on wet lab protocols. For bioinformatic guides, why not visit my website with guides on bioinformatic analysis of metagenomic data for beginners:

## 🧠 How to Use

Each protocol is written in **Markdown** (`.md`) format and clicking on the files in each folder will allow the protocols to be viewed directly in GitHub formatted correctly. All changes to protocols are tracked automatically using **Git version control**.

When a protocol is confirmed to have worked, I will publish it:
[protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/cjr_protocols)

Then I will link the published version to the latest version stored here.
